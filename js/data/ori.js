            content: "In Yoruba metaphysics, 'Orí' literally means 'head' but signifies much more than the physical head. It represents one's spiritual intuition, destiny, personal identity, and inner essence. It is considered the reflective spark of human consciousness and is often personified as an Orisha (deity) in its own right. The Yoruba believe that individuals are born with a specific destiny, and Ori is the element responsible for a person's personality and their life's course."

            content: "Ilé Orí literally translates to 'house of the head'. It is a significant concept and a physical object that serves as an altar for the veneration of a person's Orí-inú (inner head). It is typically an ornamental coffer or shrine, often made of leather and cloth, and covered with cowrie shells. These cowrie shells symbolize wealth and spiritual power. The Ilé Orí acts as a receptacle for an icon that symbolically represents the Ori, allowing for propitiation and offerings."
