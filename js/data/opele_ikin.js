        description: "The Ọ̀pẹ̀lẹ̀ is the primary divination tool used by Babaláwos for daily consultations. It is considered the 'messenger' or 'assistant' of Ọ̀rúnmìlà, facilitating rapid communication between the deity and the diviner. Typically made of eight half-nuts from the Ọ̀pẹ̀lẹ̀ fruit tree (or sometimes brass, copper, or coconut shells) linked by a chain, it reveals Odu signs based on the convex (open) or concave (closed) position of the nuts when cast.",
