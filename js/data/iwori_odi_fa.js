const WOLI_MEDJI = {
    name: "Woli-Mêdjì",
    theme: "The Sign of Dreams, Clairvoyance, and Hidden Worlds. It connects the individual to the unseen realm, nocturnal visions, premonition, and dormant spiritual capabilities.",
    symbolism: "It often indicates that women in the maternal lineage were dreamers, priestesses, or initiates. It is a sign of awakening and ordeal.",
    rank: "3rd sign among the 256 signs of Fâ",
    spiritual_meaning: "WOLI-MÊDJI is intimately linked to the invisible world, nocturnal visions, premonition, and dormant spiritual capacities. The word 'Woli' signifies 'dream' or 'revelation' in several Yoruba and Fon tradition languages. This sign plunges directly into the mystical dimension of the soul and signals that the consultant is in contact—conscious or not—with supersensible forces.",
    etymology: "'Woli' (dream/revelation) represents the portal to invisible realms and the language of the unconscious. This sign teaches that dreams are not random—they are messages from ancestors, spirits, or one's own deeper self, carrying warnings, blessings, or revelations that demand interpretation.",
    spiritual_functions: {
        heightened_intuition: "When it appears in consultation, WOLI-MÊDJI generally announces a period of heightened intuition, subtle messages transmitted through dreams, coincidences, or meditative states. It can also indicate certain truths are veiled, and only an interior—or initiated—gaze can pierce these mysteries. This sign calls for slowing down, listening to silence, interpreting symbols of daily life.",
        mediumship_gift: "A sign that reveals predisposition to mediumship, clairvoyance, or channeling spirits. Those who receive WOLI-MÊDJI are often carriers of an inherited gift or capacity to become passers between worlds. But this gift, poorly used or ignored, can turn against them in the form of psychic troubles, unexplained anxieties, or spiritual drift.",
        illusions_warning: "WOLI-MÊDJI is also the sign of illusions and false promises. It warns that all that glitters is not light, certain appearances are deceptive, and manipulations can hide behind beguiling discourse. It guards against false prophets, corrupt spiritual leaders, or even friends with doubtful intentions.",
        maternal_lineage: "Has a profound link with the moon, water, and feminine spirits. It often indicates women of the maternal lineage were dreamers, priestesses, or initiates, and the consultant carries this heritage. It is advised to question elderly women of the family, reconnect with the maternal lineage, or perform rituals linked to water and emotional purification.",
        emotional_depth: "On the emotional plane, WOLI-MÊDJI speaks of deep sufferings, often repressed or unexpressed. It is frequent for this sign to announce a period of mental fatigue, existential doubts, even spiritual crisis. The remedy: do not flee this interior darkness, but inhabit it, explore it, for it contains treasures of transformation.",
        initiatic_search: "WOLI-MÊDJI is also a sign of initiatic research. It invites consulting an experienced diviner, a spiritual master, or following esoteric formation. This is not a sign of passivity: it's a call to awakening. It signals the moment has come to enter a new order of understanding, to cross a threshold of consciousness.",
        karmic_dimension: "On the karmic plane, this sign indicates strong links with past lives. It evokes unsettled debts, past oaths, or wounds from other times that resurface today as blockages. WOLI-MÊDJI pushes the consultant to make a transgenerational or karmic reading of their current existence to liberate these invisible chains."
    },
    ritual_guidance: {
        nocturnal_rituals: "It is often recommended to perform nocturnal rituals with this sign: offerings under the moon, purification by water, prayers at daybreak.",
        sacred_objects: "Use of objects like mirrors, shells, crystals, or incenses based on lunar plants (like mugwort or lavender) is counseled to strengthen connection to the world of visions.",
        protection: "WOLI-MÊDJI protects sincere dreamers, seekers of the absolute, poets of the soul... but does not tolerate spiritual hypocrisy. It must be honored with humility, listening to what it reveals in the silence of nights, and advancing with faith on the interior path."

This sign calls for moral endurance, discipline, and spirit of sacrifice.",

It pushes for deep work on the unconscious: therapy, spiritual retreat, liberation ritual. Not doing this work can lead to serious blockages, even psychosomatic illnesses or repetitive losses.",
        ancestral_curses: "It is frequent that DI-MÊDJI reveals the existence of ancestral maledictions or unresolved pacts in the lineage. This sign thus pushes to investigate family history, ask questions of elders, understand repetitive patterns, and initiate reparation rituals. It also demands honoring forgotten ancestors, or interrupting inherited toxic cycles.",
        karmic_initiation: "This sign has a strong karmic and initiatic connotation. It often marks a life turning point: the consultant is ready to enter a new phase, but only if they accept to let the old version of themselves die. DI-MÊDJI teaches there is no rebirth without destruction, no light without passage through darkness.",
        social_conflicts: "On the social plane, DI-MÊDJI announces conflicts, betrayals, or profound disagreements, often within the family or professional circle. It warns that certain bonds must be cut, alliances must be reconsidered, and all unhealthy dependency must cease. It calls for autonomy, discernment, and detachment.",
        empowerment: "This sign also invites retaking control of one's destiny. It warns that remaining passive or in self-illusion will only amplify problems. One must act, change, cut, decide. It's a sign of maturity, saying: 'you can no longer flee, you must face it.' It sometimes recommends consulting an experienced babalawo to guide the energetic cleansing process.",
        warrior_protection: "DI-MÊDJI is also protective, on condition that its laws are respected. It defends those who purify themselves, who speak truth, who confront their pain with faith. It opens doors of alchemical transformation. It is also the sign of spiritual warriors, soul therapists, those who accompany others in their interior nights."

    summary: "In summary, DI-MÊDJI is the sign of redemptive ordeal. It never brings comfort, but always the opportunity to grow, to free oneself, to be reborn. It says: 'Cross the darkness, and you will see who you really are.' Those who receive it must prepare to change skin, to break their chains, and to forge a new version of themselves, more just, more free, more true."
