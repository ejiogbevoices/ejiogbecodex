const YEKU_MEDJI = {
    name: "Yêku-Mêdjì",

    theme: "The Sign of Wisdom of the Darkness, the world of ancestors, and death. It is the Odu that introduced death (kou) to the world and commands the defunct. It is a sign of Justice, Memory, and the Sacred Word.",
    origin: "Originally considered the first and eldest Fadu, but lost primacy due to failing to respect principles.",
    spiritual_meaning: "YÊKOU-MÊDJI is profoundly linked to the word, to spoken truth, and to the power of the verb. 'Yêkou' literally means 'mouth' or 'voice,' making this sign the guardian of sacred speech, of oaths, of curses as well as blessings. When it appears in consultation, it immediately draws attention to all that has been said - or not said - and the consequences that follow. It is the sign par excellence of divine and human justice.",
    etymology: "'Yêkou' (mouth/voice) represents the power of the spoken word. This sign teaches that words can create or destroy - they can bind two people for life through a love oath or shatter a destiny through slander. It demands mastery of language, speaking only when necessary, avoiding hasty judgments, and never pronouncing destructive words in anger.",
    spiritual_functions: {
        justice: "Evokes trials, family conflicts, social disagreements, and accumulated injustices. It warns that nothing remains hidden indefinitely - truth will eventually emerge. Those who have lied, betrayed, or slandered must answer for their acts. But it also protects the just, the oppressed, those whose voices have been silenced.",
        ancestral_portal: "A portal to ancestral memory. It indicates ancestors speak through dreams, visions, or intuitions. It invites the consultant to listen to invisible murmurs, to pay attention to signs and messages from the beyond. When this sign appears, performing a ritual to call ancestors or purifying the family altar is often recommended.",
        diplomacy: "Associated with diplomacy, oratory art, and mediators' wisdom. May indicate the consultant possesses a natural gift for appeasing tensions, finding the right words to heal, or intervening in delicate situations. It is the sign of teachers, judges, priests, and sacred orators.",
        family_secrets: "Often brings to light family secrets, truths buried for generations, forgotten pacts, or transgenerational curses. It demands light be shed on these shadow zones to allow the family soul to find peace. Ignoring these revelations can lead to karmic blockages, even spiritual illnesses."
    },
    mirror_function: "Sometimes seen as a mirror - a sign that reflects interior truths. It confronts the individual with themselves, their contradictions, their unspoken words, their unexpressed wounds. It pushes toward confession, emotional liberation, alignment between what one thinks, says, and does.",
    characteristics: "The native is reckless and formidable. Often courageous, intelligent, becomes a good chief or leader. However, can be a champion of hypocrisy, temptation, covetousness, and boasting. Respects given word - one can trust them to keep their word. Loves family and friends. Hardworking, good natured. Will be popular but will know disappointments. Great traveler, will spend very little time at home. Fairly un-wealthy but will never lack for anything.",

    relational_guidance: "Evokes ruptures due to verbal misunderstandings or profound misunderstandings. Essential to learn to communicate well, to ask forgiveness when necessary, to clarify intentions. A dispute under this sign can break a marriage, just as reconciliation under this sign can strengthen it forever.",
    ritual_offerings: "Often counseled to make offerings to the divinity of the word (Esu or Légba) - deposit kola, gin, or pepper at the crossroads to open communication pathways. This clears blockages and prevents words from being twisted or misunderstood.",
    protection: "Protects those who speak truth, but punishes those who abuse language. Demands purifying memory, listening to ancient voices, and reconciling with one's interior truth to progress in life without invisible chains.",

Titigouéti consulted Fâ and was told to prepare three gourds (Ata n'gué) containing white kaolin juice, red kaolin juice, and smoke debris in water. During battle, Titigouéti flew onto the elephant's head, dodging its trunk. He broke the black gourd making it appear the elephant was crying, the red gourd making it appear he'd bloodied its head, and the white gourd making it appear he'd reached its brain. The king stopped the fight and declared Titigouéti the victor. The small bird returned to honor Fâ through 'Fâ lilè' ceremony, singing: 'Titigouéti wè Kpà Ajinaku! Gboungbo yégué! Oyégué gbohoungbo' - meaning though small, Titigouéti definitively defeated the elephant.",
